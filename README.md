# Snake Attempt 3

This is my third, most successful attempt at recreating the classic game Snake.  
**WARNING: This game contains flashing lights. Do not run this if you have photosensitive epilepsy.**


## Installation/Execution
### bash/zsh
Run `git clone https://epicary22/snake_attempt_3.git <directory>`, where `<directory>` is the
directory you want to clone this repository into.  
Make sure that pygame is installed by running `python3 -m pip install pygame` in the `<directory>`.  
**BEFORE RUNNING: This game contains flashing lights. Do not run this if you have photosensitive epilepsy.**  
To run the program, run `python3 game.py` from the `<directory>`.

## How to play
Upon loading, the game should look like this:

Start the game by pressing any arrow key. Your snake will start moving in this direction.  
The snake is controlled with the arrow keys.

The objective of the game is to eat the small fruits on the ground, which increase your score and the snake's length.
Try to eat as many as you can without running into yourself!
